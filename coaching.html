        <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 0, 98);">    He allure of an IIT education has made boomtowns of places. Some, like Kota in Rajasthan, have virtually become ' coaching factories' churning out hundreds of successful IIT applicants every year.

            Kota draws thousands of students from all over the country who enroll in institutes to prepare for IIT-JEE. " Your ticket to your dream IIT" reads the logo of one of the leading coaching institutes in Kota. An IIT aspirant who comes to town is told not to worry about Class XII board exams conducted by the CBSE. Coaching institutes tell students that they will be admitted in local secondary school they have tie- ups with, where attending classes is optional.
            Such elaborate arrangements allow a student to focus full- time on IIT- JEE preparation.

            Getting admission in these institutes, however, is not necessarily a cakewalk. An entrance test is conducted, which enables institutes to take in the cream of the students so that their success rate remains high.
            
            Regular tests are also held after the commencement of the classes for the new academic year. A candidate is expected to obtain maximum attendance during the course period.

            Kota's rise as an IIT coaching hub began in 1985 when V. K. Bansal, an engineer employed with the citybased J. K. Synthetics Ltd since 1971            set up Bansal Classes that subsequently became Bansal Classes Private Limited.
 Bansal began giving tuitions to Class VII students in 1981 and subsequently took on Class X and XII students.
 
 The turning point came in 1985, when his first student cleared the IIT- JEE examination . He set up Bansal Classes, and in 1991, he took voluntary retirement when it dawned on him that he had laid his hands on something big.
The Bansal empire now has branches in 16 cities countrywide.However, in Kota itself, where the Bansal story began, some faculty broke away to set up their own coaching institutes. All these institutes do business running into crores.
Each student who enrolls has to pay around Rs 80,000 per annum besides making private arrangements for lodging as the institutes don't have offer boarding facilities.

People rent out a portion of their houses to these students who shack up in groups of two- three in a room.
City restaurants, too, are happy having assured customers whose number runs into thousands on a regular basis.U NION human resource development ( HRD) minister Kapil Sibal's alleged proposal - to raise the IIT eligibility bar to 80- 85 per cent in Class XII from 60 per cent as of now - could ring the death knell for Kota's institutes.

But students preparing for IIT at these institutes asserted that things would remain the same until the HRD ministry or the CBSE redesigns the curriculum to align it closer to that of the IITJEE syllabus.

For as long as the two syllabi remained mutually exclusive, the " coaching factories" would continue to thrive.

Following in the footsteps of Bansal Classes, Allen Career Institute, etc. Resonance and Vibrant and various other institutes have also established themselves in Kota. Every year, around 1.5-2 lakh students enrol in various coaching institutions in Kota.

The scent emanated from trees of neem, mango and guava, rose bushes and vines of chameli, mogra, and raat ki rani – varieties of jasmine – that grew in plenty in this Rajasthan city. Life was pleasantly slow, accompanied by a moderate climate, clean and green atmosphere and wide roads.
Today, as I step out of the railway station, huge hoardings of coaching institutes – Allen, Bansal Classes, Resonance, Rao Academy, Career Point, and so on – greet me. They fill the skyline and haunt you for miles till you reach the industrial area, the coaching hub. I can imagine how the stories that the hoardings dish out through pictures of successful candidates and numbers of those who ‘topped’ entrance exams of top institutes impact the minds of both parents and students.

Some 1.5 to 2 lakh students come to Kota chasing their dreams each year, but only a fraction of them make it. While many, like Rupesh Kushwaha of Nanakhedi village in Madhya Pradesh, realise that they are not cut out for the tough regimen of coaching, for most of them it is often too late. Rupesh was one of the victims of the rat race; he ended his life in August, in his third month of coaching. However, locals are furious at the media’s propensity to focus on student suicides – 35 recorded last year and 16 this year so far. They fear such coverage could give the city a bad name, and make students look elsewhere – without solving the problem at all.
